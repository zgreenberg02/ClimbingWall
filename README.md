This 10-foot climbing wall, built in my attic, features six different wall angles and a customizable hold layout, offering a versatile and challenging training environment for rock climbing competitions. The project involved meticulous structural design for stability, strategic wall placement to accommodate dynamic route setting, and efficient use of space to enhance strength, technique, and endurance training indoors.
