This 10-foot climbing wall, designed and built in my attic, features four overhang angles and a customizable hold layout, providing a challenging and versatile training environment for rock climbing competitions. The project involved meticulous structural design for stability, strategic wall placement to accommodate dynamic route setting, and efficient use of space to enhance strength, technique, and endurance training indoors.
